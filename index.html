            <p>Hello there and welcome to my website! Allow me to introduct myself, my name is Garrett Howard and I am the author of this website. The page that you are viewing currently is the home page. To the left of your screen, you will see a sidebar with links that will eventually lead to different web pages. Unfortunately, the different web pages are not available at this time but I hope to create each of them in the near future. For now, I will continue my introduction.</p>
            
            <p>I was born in Chattanooga, Tennessee on October 31, 1995. My family and I lived in this city for five years before moving to the Gulf Coast in Mobile, Alabama. Once there, I lived Mobile, Alabama for a decade before moving to Roanoke, Virginia in 2010. Since living in Roanoke, Virginia, I have enjoy watching the mountains, hiking and taking pictures of the Blue Ridge Parkway, and hanging out with my friends and Christian family from Calvary Chapel Roanoke. Based upon the date of my birthday, I am twenty three years old as of this writing. I am also a current residential Liberty University student.</p>
            
            <p>As a current student at Liberty University, my current major is information technology. Before my current major, my previous two majors were Studio and Digital Arts and Interdisciplinary Studies. I still plan on getting a minor for the first former major but the current major that I am in is quite enjoyable and fits my skill set for the modern day work a day world. Since I was young, I always enjoyed computer hardware but never understood computer software. Since being at Liberty University, I have already learn two programming languages in Java and Python. In my current classes, I am learn more about HTML and CSS, JavaScript, and PHP for web architecture, client-side programming, and server-side programming. My minor in information technology is web and mobile programming. I enjoy the problem solving aspects of mobile programming and the creativity of web architecture development. In the near future, when it is time for me to graduate, I plan on using my bachelor's degree to help small businesses and Christian ministries by building websites and mobile applications for them and solving their technological difficulties. </p>
